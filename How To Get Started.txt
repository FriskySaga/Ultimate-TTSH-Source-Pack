For CFO, WAIT until Mata Harry starts TALKING, then type "~rcr" twice.
	If you ~rcr too early, you will crash.
	If you ~rcr only once and hop on a crane, you will crash as well.

For CJ, if you want the podium there, type "cannons", then "~rsc".
	If you only ~rsc, the CJ will be floating; however the podium will remain on the ground.
	If you do the cannon round, the scale will appear as it normally would.
